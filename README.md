# Bikeshare_Data_Exploration

This is my submission to the Visualization Project on Udacity's Advanced Data Analysis Nanodegree.

In this project we explore a data set and try to do both exploratory and explanatory visualizations, while cleaning and analyzing the data.
The main focus here is to implement Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate visualizations correctly, and create a slide deck to explain the insights we found using the explanatory visualizations.

If you are trying to do the project on Udacity, feel free to check out my solution, but please don't copy it :)
